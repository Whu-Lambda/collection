- 如何处理错误



# 错误处理基本原则

- Libraries should focus on *producing* meaningful, structured error types/variants. This allows applications to easily differentiate various error cases.
- Applications mainly *consume* errors.
- Libraries may want to cast errors from one type to another. An IO error should likely be wrapped by a high-level error type provided by the library.
    - Otherwise an IO error in library `foo` cannot be distinguished from a similar IO error in library `bar`.
    - Not doing so also requires the consumer to know library internals. For example, is it just IO errors that might be returned? What about HTTP errors that might originate from an HTTP client internal to the library?
- Libraries must be careful when changing errors or creating new errors, as these can easily introduce breaking changes for consumers. They may produce new errors internally, but these are unlikely to require special structure and can be more easily changed at will.
- Where libraries return errors, applications decide if and how those errors are formatted and displayed to users.
- Applications may also want to parse and inspect errors, for example to forward them to exception tracking services or to retry operations when doing so is deemed to be safe.

Additionally, and I think this is quite important, **libraries should always use [std::Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) together with an error type implementing [std::error::Error](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html) in their public APIs**. Custom result types like [failure::Fail](https://docs.rs/failure/0.1.8/failure/trait.Fail.html) may not compose well with other parts of your user’s code and force them to learn yet another library.



# crate `thiserror`

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

/// WordCountError enumerates all possible errors returned by this library.
#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum WordCountError {
    /// Represents an empty source. For example, an empty text file being given
    /// as input to `count_words()`.
    #[error("Source contains no data")]
    EmptySource,

    /// Represents a failure to read from input.
    #[error("Read error")]
    ReadError { source: std::io::Error },

    /// Represents all other cases of `std::io::Error`.
    #[error(transparent)]
    IOError(#[from] std::io::Error),
}
```



# crate anyhow

```rust
// Some `use` statements have been omitted here for brevity
use anyhow::{Context, Result};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    for filename in env::args().skip(1).collect::<Vec<String>>() {
        let mut reader = File::open(&filename).context(format!("unable to open '{}'", filename))?;
        let wordcount =
            count_words(&mut reader).context(format!("unable to count words in '{}'", filename))?;
        println!("{} {}", wordcount, filename);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```
